# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `clean_merge.R`, does the following on the downloaded file:


1. Load the activity and feature info
2. Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which
   reflect a mean or standard deviation
3. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those
   columns with the dataset
4. Merges the two datasets
5. Converts the `activity` and `subject` columns into factors
6. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `tidy.txt`.
